<h2>At this point I need to fix the tables so that I can match keys.</h2>
<h2>Narrative for Matching Tables and Integrating Data</h2>
<h3>Understanding Table Relationships:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>State and State Population Tables:</strong>
        <ul>
            <li>Identify and verify that <code>state.name</code> in the <code>state</code> table matches <code>statepop.name</code> in the <code>statepop</code> table correctly. This ensures that each state's population data (<code>statepop</code>) corresponds accurately to the state details (<code>state</code>).</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Part 1: Get the Correct State Name:</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Match the state abbreviation (<code>stusps</code>) from the <code>state</code> table with the state name from the <code>statepop</code> table.</p>
<p><strong>SQL Code:</strong></p>
<pre><code>SELECT stusps, statepop.*
FROM state, statepop
WHERE state.name = statepop.name;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Action Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Review the output to ensure that each <code>stusps</code> (state abbreviation) in the <code>state</code> table correctly corresponds to the respective state's population data (<code>statepop</code>).</li>
</ul>

<h3>Part 2: Join States and COVID Data:</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Integrate COVID-19 data (<code>daily</code> table) with state population data (<code>statepop</code>) using state abbreviations (<code>stusps</code>) as the key.</p>
<p><strong>SQL Code:</strong></p>
<pre><code>SELECT *
FROM
    (SELECT geometry, stusps, statepop.*
     FROM state, statepop
     WHERE state.name = statepop.name
    ) AS stpop,
    (SELECT state, sum(positiveIncrease) AS totpositive
     FROM daily
     GROUP BY state
    ) AS stcovid
WHERE stcovid.state = stpop.stusps;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Action Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Confirm that the <code>stusps</code> from <code>state</code> correctly links with <code>statepop.name</code>.</li>
    <li>Verify that <code>stcovid.state</code> in the subquery accurately aggregates COVID-19 data (<code>positiveIncrease</code>) per state.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Part 3: Calculate Percent Positive:</h3>
<p><strong>Objective:</strong> Compute the percentage of positive COVID-19 cases relative to the state population estimate.</p>
<p><strong>SQL Code:</strong></p>
<pre><code>SELECT geometry, stusps,
    CAST(totpositive AS real) / CAST(popestimate2019 AS real) AS percentpositive,
    totpositive
FROM
    (SELECT geometry, stusps, statepop.*
     FROM state, statepop
     WHERE state.name = statepop.name
    ) AS stpop,
    (SELECT state, sum(positiveIncrease) AS totpositive
     FROM daily
     GROUP BY state
    ) AS stcovid
WHERE stcovid.state = stpop.stusps;</code></pre>
<p><strong>Action Steps:</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Ensure that <code>popestimate2019</code> in <code>statepop</code> accurately reflects the estimated population for each state.</li>
    <li>Validate the calculation of <code>percentpositive</code> to correctly represent the percentage of positive cases relative to the state's population.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Key Considerations:</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Data Consistency:</strong> Verify that state names (<code>state.name</code> and <code>statepop.name</code>) are consistent across both tables.</li>
    <li><strong>Join Conditions:</strong> Double-check join conditions (<code>stcovid.state = stpop.stusps</code>) to ensure accurate data linkage.</li>
    <li><strong>Calculation Accuracy:</strong> Validate calculations (<code>percentpositive</code>) to accurately reflect the intended metrics.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Narrative for the last part</h2>
<p>This script drops any existing <code>spatialtable</code>, then creates a new table named <code>spatialtable</code>. It populates this table with geographic data (<code>geometry</code>) and calculates the percentage of positive COVID-19 cases relative to the estimated state population (<code>percentpositive</code>). The data is sourced from joined information in <code>state</code> and <code>statepop</code> tables for state details and population estimates, and <code>daily</code> table for COVID-19 statistics aggregated by state. Finally, it ensures that the <code>geometry</code> column is properly configured for spatial data using the <code>recovergeometrycolumn</code> function.</p>
<p>We run this in Spatialite_gui not here, but I have it here for documentation.</p>
<pre><code>DROP TABLE IF EXISTS spatialtable;
